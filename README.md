## 1. Research Area  
This project—**Propositum**—falls within educational technology and personal development platforms. Propositum is a chatbot‑driven web application that guides Brazilian pre‑adolescents and teenagers (ages 10–18) through self‑knowledge exercises, goal setting, and introductory AI literacy. By providing accessible, interactive guidance, Propositum fills the gap left by limited school‑based psychological support and empowers young users to build clear, achievable life roadmaps.

## 2. Overview of Sprints  

> **Sprint deliverables drawn from our Module 1 checklist:**  

### Sprint 1: Foundations & Framework  
**Delivered:**  
- Proposal & User Definition: complete written proposal outlining motivation, problem statement, objectives, and scope  
- Stakeholder Interviews: initial interview summaries with school administrators and educators  
- Market Research: competitive analysis of existing edtech and life‑planning tools  
- Problem Understanding: synthesized insights into a clear problem definition  
- Cronograma: detailed project timeline for Module 1 activities  

### Sprint 2: Strategic Analysis & Personas  
**Delivered:**  
- SWOT & PESTEL Analysis: comprehensive matrices assessing internal strengths/weaknesses and external factors  
- Empathy Map: two empathy maps capturing what our personas **say**, **think**, **feel**, and **do**  
- Persona Profiles: detailed profiles for **Gustavo Mendes** (student) and **Amanda Braz** (school psychologist)  

### Sprint 3: User Stories & Journey Mapping  
**Delivered:**  
- Empathy Map Refinement: updated empathy maps based on feedback and deeper insights  
- User Stories: prioritized user stories for both personas, e.g.:  
  - “As Gustavo, I want an interactive quiz to explore my interests so that I can discover potential career paths.”  
  - “As Amanda, I want to view aggregated student progress so that I can tailor my guidance sessions.”  
- User Journey Maps: two end‑to‑end journey maps detailing each persona’s experience—from first contact through goal achievement—highlighting emotional highs, lows, and key touchpoints  

### Sprint 4: Business Modeling & Risk Assessment  
**Delivered:**  
- Risk Matrix: visual matrix classifying risks by probability and impact, with mitigation strategies (e.g., LGPD compliance, pilot partnerships, technical modularity)  
- Business Model Canvas: complete canvas covering nine blocks: Key Partners, Key Activities, Value Propositions, Customer Segments, Channels, Customer Relationships, Revenue Streams, Key Resources, and Cost Structure  

### Sprint 5: Qualitative Research, Financial Analysis & Documentation  
**Delivered:**  
- Qualitative Research: two expert interviews and thematic analysis summarizing insights on user needs and technology acceptance  
- Financial Analysis: Year 1 cost breakdown (R$ 128 000) and three‑year projection showing break‑even in Year 2 under a license‑fee model (R$ 2 560 per school)  
- Documentation: finalized all Module 1 artifacts and compiled this public report  

---  

## 3. Conclusions  
Module 1 produced a robust set of deliverables:  
- Artifacts: proposal, interview summaries, market research, SWOT/PESTEL, empathy maps, personas, user stories, journey maps, risk matrix, Business Model Canvas, qualitative research, and financial projections  
- Insights: clear problem framing around the lack of interactive guidance for youth life planning; strong evidence of demand from both students and educators; and a viable business model pending pilot validation  

These deliverables establish a solid foundation for design and prototyping in Module 2.

## 4. Next Steps  
In **Module 2**, we plan to:  
1. **Design & Prototype**  
   - Create high‑fidelity Figma mockups of the chatbot interface, student dashboard, and educator dashboard  
   - Define interaction flows, information architecture, and visual style  
2. **Usability Testing**  
   - Conduct prototype testing sessions with a pilot group of students and school staff to validate usability and gather feedback  

> _Note: The focus on design and prototyping may adapt based on ongoing stakeholder feedback or technical constraints._
